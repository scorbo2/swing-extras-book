# swing-extras-book

## What is this?

This is the source for the documentation guide for my [swing-extras](https://github.com/scorbo2/swing-extras) library.
This is current as of the 2.0.0 release of `swing-extras`.

## You can view this online!

The generate version of this documentation is viewable online:

<a href="http://www.corbett.ca/swing-extras-book/">http://www.corbett.ca/swing-extras-book/</a>

## How do I build it locally?

You can clone this repo and use [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html) (not my project) to build it:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/scorbo2/swing-extras-book.git
cd swing-extras-book
mdbook build --open
```

This will build the documentation locally and open it in your web browser.
