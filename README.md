## How do I build it locally?

You can clone this repo and use [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html) (not my project) to build it:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/scorbo2/swing-extras-book.git
cd swing-extras-book
mdbook build --open
```

This will build the documentation locally and open it in your web browser.
