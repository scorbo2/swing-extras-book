# Gradients

The `ca.corbett.extras.gradient` package contains some neat utilities and components related
to color gradients. Let's start with a visual demonstration of the capabilities, and then take
a look at the code.

![Gradients3](gradient_util3.png "Gradients3") ![Gradients4](gradient_util4.png "Gradients4")

We can also render text with a color gradient:

![Gradient text](gradient_util_text.png "Gradient text")

## Integration with swing-forms

There is a `GradientColorField` that can be embedded onto a `swing-forms` FormPanel, or you can 
manually use the `GradientColorChooser` to allow your users to configure a color gradient 
interactively.

## Integration with properties

The `ColorProperty` property in `ca.corbett.extras.properties` understands both solid colors
or color gradients, and allows you to create a property that allows the user to choose either
one, or restricts them to one or the other.

## Other integrations

If your application uses a `JDesktopPane`, you may want to consider upgrading to the
`swing-extras` class [CustomizableDesktopPane](../general/DesktopPane.md), which allows you
to use a gradient as a background.

Of course, the gradient images generated by the `GradientUtil` are compatible with
`ImageUtil`, so you can easily generate gradient images and save them.

## How do I generate gradients?

Everything is driven from the `GradientConfig` class, which is very easy to set up (javadoc
omitted for brevity):

```java
public final class GradientConfig {
    // ...
    
    public void resetToDefaults() {...}
    public void setGradientType(GradientUtil.GradientType gradientType) {...}
    public GradientUtil.GradientType getGradientType() {...}
    public Color getColor1() {...}
    public Color getColor2() {...}
    public void setColor1(Color color1) {...}
    public void setColor2(Color color2) {...}

    public void loadFromProps(Properties props, String prefix) {...}
    public void saveToProps(Properties props, String prefix) {...}
}
```

Basically, we set the two colors for our gradient, and then choose a `GradientType`:

```java
public enum GradientType {

    /**
     * Describes a single gradient that progresses linearly from left to right, color 1 to color 2.
     */
    HORIZONTAL_LINEAR("Horizontal linear"),

    /**
     * Describes a single gradient that progresses linearly from top to bottom, color 1 to color 2.
     */
    VERTICAL_LINEAR("Vertical linear"),

    /**
     * Describes a two-part gradient that progresses linearly from top to center, color 1 to
     * color 2, and then center to bottom, color 2 to color 1. The end result is a gradient that
     * looks like a horizontal stripe running along the center of the image.
     */
    HORIZONTAL_STRIPE("Horizontal stripe"),

    /**
     * Describes a two-part gradient that progresses linearly from left to center, color 1 to
     * color 2, and then center to right, color 2 to color 1. The end result is a gradient that
     * looks like a vertical stripe running up the center of the image.
     */
    VERTICAL_STRIPE("Vertical stripe"),

    /**
     * Represents a single gradient that progresses linearly from top left to bottom right,
     * color 1 to color 2.
     */
    DIAGONAL1("Diagonal 1"),

    /**
     * Represents a single gradient that progresses linearly from bottom left to top right,
     * color 1 to color 2.
     */
    DIAGONAL2("Diagonal 2"),

    /**
     * Describes a four-part gradient that progresses linearly from each corner of the image
     * towards the center, color 1 to color 2.
     */
    STAR("Star");
    
    // ...
}
```

From there, we can talk to the `GradientUtil` class, which has methods for actually rendering the gradient:

```java
public static BufferedImage createGradientImage(GradientConfig conf, int width, int height) {...}
public static void fill(GradientConfig conf, Graphics2D graphics, int x1, int y1, int width, int height) {...}
public static void drawRect(GradientConfig conf, Graphics2D graphics, int x1, int y1, int width, int height) {...}
public static void drawString(GradientConfig conf, Graphics2D graphics, int textX, int textY, String string) {...}
public static void drawString(GradientConfig conf, Graphics2D graphics, int gradientX1, int gradientY1, 
                              int gradientX2, int gradientY2, int textX, int textY, String string) {...}
```

We see that every method requires a `GradientConfig` which describes the gradient to be rendered, and then there
are options to control the size and shape of the gradient. Very easy to use, and can produce quite nice results!
